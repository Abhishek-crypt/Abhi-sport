     India win by 11 runs on the back of a very strong finish to their innings and an excellent performance in the field. Australia had a good start to the chase but struggled badly after Finch departed. Decent story out of the match with Chahal, who came in as a concussion sub for Jadeja, playing a key role with the ball (after Jadeja had done with the bat)

         </P>
        <p>
It was a remarkable match in the principal T20I, right? Contention, force swings and dramatization featured a match brimming with ideas, as India took a 1-0 arrangement lead.
</P>
   <p>
       Presently, the inquiry for the Indians will be whether they can imitate their Canberra structure at Sydney, where they were poor in the initial two ODIs. Certainty will be high, in any case, on two fronts. The first is that India have won both their T20Is against Australia at the SCG. Furthermore, there is a decent possibility that Australia will be without captain Aaron Finch because of injury, which will well and really test Australia's profundity.
</P>
   <p>
Things being what they are, by what method will Australia react to their physical issue stresses and the first up thrashing.
